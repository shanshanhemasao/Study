PCA
Instead of describing the data with the original features, we describe it with its axes of variation (rotate the axes based on the variation)
theoretically, the number of principal components the same with the number of orginal features, but in most of the cases, we only use the first two (normally take 80% of the variation)
The principal components are the linear combinations(weighted sum(components' loads) of original features.
For non-standardised data, variation is covariance/ for standardized data, variation is correlation.
Percent of explained variance
Ways to use PCA for feature engineering: dimension reduction(multicolinearity)/ anormaly detection (low variance components) / increase signal-to-noise ratio (noise reduction) / decorrelation
Best Practice of PCA: numeric variables only; standardization; sensitive to outliers
